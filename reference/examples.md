# Live Session Examples

Reference examples from actual sessions. Cited in the framework for pattern recognition.

## GEX Wall Decay (2026-02-23)
6845 wall: +2,589 → +1,945 → +1,225 → +485 (81% erosion over ~1 hour). By final read, no longer meaningful resistance.

## CEX Spent Magnet (2026-02-24)
6890 CEX flipped between suppressive (+96.77) and supportive (-16.64) multiple times as price oscillated. Each flip = dealer hedging consuming charm flow. Support zones flipped to selling after price arrived.

## CEX Path Blocking (2026-02-24)
At 6887, sell barrier to 6900: +150.15 (6890) + +38.60 (6895) = +188.75 suppressive CEX. Despite -110 supportive at 6905, the barrier prevented 6900 for hours.

## 6940 Wall Lifecycle (2026-02-25)
Birth (+75.65) → decay (-32%) → collapse (-1.53) → inversion (-98.91). Positioning led: customer sold positions at 6940 declined from +3176 to +2090 before wall collapsed.

## 6945 Amplifier Dominance (2026-02-25)
Grew from -98.42 to -426.18 across session. Adjacent 6950 pin wall was only +8 to +13 (20-30x smaller). Close at 6946.14 — amplifier gravity dominated. Pin at 6950 missed by 3.86 pts.

## CEX Migration Predicting Close (2026-02-25)
Support migrated 6945→6940 between final two reads. Close landed 3.86 pts below the 6950 pin estimate — in line with the migration direction.
