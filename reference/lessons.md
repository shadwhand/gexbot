# Lessons Learned (Supplementary Context)

Not hard rules — treat as considerations when the relevant pattern appears.

## Pin Estimation: Amplifier-Pin Ratio
When a GEX amplifier >10x adjacent pin wall's magnitude, the amplifier's gravity dominates. Estimate equilibrium closer to the amplifier strike, weighted by relative magnitude. (2026-02-25: 6945 at -273 vs 6950 at +13 → close 6946.14)

## Pin Estimation: CEX Migration Direction
Peak supportive CEX migrating to a lower strike = equilibrium shifting down. Adjust pin/target ~3-5 pts in migration direction. (2026-02-25: support 6945→6940, missed by 3.86 pts)

## Wall Collapse vs Direction Change
Single wall collapse ≠ directional regime change. Check VWAP, net CEX, positioning before downgrading. If macro intact, adjust levels — don't flip the call. (2026-02-25: 6940 collapse, but VWAP +33 and support growing → premature neutral downgrade)

## VWAP in Low-Vol Sessions
VIX range <1.5 pts + mixed GEX → VWAP is most reliable signal. VEX low impact, GEX ambiguous. Weight VWAP higher. (2026-02-25: VWAP best signal all session)

## Steady CEX Growth = High Reliability
CEX growing monotonically (same sign, larger magnitude) across 3+ reads = highly reliable support/resistance. CEX that flips sign = volatile, less predictable. (2026-02-25: 6955 grew 5 reads straight. 6945 flipped mid-session.)

## Customer Pin Bets as Wall Health
Customers selling premium both sides at a strike confirms a wall. Unwinding those positions = wall weakening — expect GEX decay within 1-2 reads. (2026-02-25: customer positions at 6940 declined before wall collapsed)
